</div>
Nicolas Gaillard (PhD, Micro- and Nano-electronics, Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France) has over 10 years of experience in materials science, 
with an emphasis in the areas of photovoltaics, photoelectrochemical hydrogen production and integrated circuits. Following his graduate work, Dr. Gaillard 
spent 3 years with the IBM/Motorola/STMicroelectronics alliance working on oxide/metal interfaces for CMOS transistors and DRAM memories applications. 
He joined the Thin Films Laboratory of the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 2007 as a post-doctoral, working under 
the supervision of Dr. Eric Miller on metal oxide thin films for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Dr. Gaillard was appointed faculty and Thin 
Films Laboratory group leader in 2010. Dr. Gaillard’s current research projects include: (i) engineering of high efficiency PEC materials, with an emphasis 
on chalcopyrite materials (CuInGaSSe) and (ii) the development of novel nanocrystal inks for printable thin film photovoltaics.

Matthieu Dubarry (PhD, Electrochemistry & Solid State Science, University of Nantes), 
has over 10 years of experience in renewable energy, with an emphasis in the area of 
lithium ion batteries. Following his PhD on the synthesis and characterization of materials 
for lithium batteries, Dr. Dubarry joined the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute at the University 
of Hawaii at Mānoa as a post-doctoral fellow in 2005 to work on the analysis of the usage of a 
fleet of electric vehicles. He was later appointed a faculty position in 2010 with a focus on 
battery testing, modeling and simulation. While working for HNEI, Dr. Dubarry pioneered the use 
of new techniques for the analysis of the degradation of Li-ion cells and developed numerous software 
tools facilitating the prognosis of Li-ion battery degradation both at the single cell and the battery
pack level. Current projects include the evaluation of grid scale Li-ion battery energy storage systems; 
the evaluation of the impact of vehicle-to-grid strategies on electric vehicle battery pack degradation; 
and the testing of emerging battery technologies for grid-connected and transportation applications.

Joseph J. Brown (PhD University of Colorado Boulder) has worked on a diverse array of materials and 
mechanical engineering research since 1999, centered on nanoscale device and materials engineering, 
including precision assembly, experimental mechanics, fluid processing, and applications of nanostructures 
and nanoscale systems. He joined the UHM Mechanical Engineering department in August 2017. He was previously 
a Research Scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder Department of Mechanical Engineering, and served 
there as a Lecturer in 2014-2015, teaching classes of up to 90 students. He received an A.B. in Engineering 
Sciences from Dartmouth College in 2000, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the 
University of Colorado Boulder in 2008 and 2010, respectively. He helped found a company that provided 
nanotube textiles used on NASA’s Juno mission to Jupiter. He is author of 16 journal articles, 9 conference 
papers, and 1 book chapter, and he is an inventor of 5 U.S. patents and 11 international patents. Dr. Brown’s 
current projects include sensor fabrication using atomic layer deposition (ALD), interlocking surface 
structures for manufacturing, research into contact electrification.
