Matthieu Dubarry (PhD, Electrochemistry & Solid State Science, University of Nantes), 
has over 10 years of experience in renewable energy, with an emphasis in the area of 
lithium ion batteries. Following his PhD on the synthesis and characterization of materials 
for lithium batteries, Dr. Dubarry joined the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute at the University 
of Hawaii at Mānoa as a post-doctoral fellow in 2005 to work on the analysis of the usage of a 
fleet of electric vehicles. He was later appointed a faculty position in 2010 with a focus on 
battery testing, modeling and simulation. While working for HNEI, Dr. Dubarry pioneered the use 
of new techniques for the analysis of the degradation of Li-ion cells and developed numerous software 
tools facilitating the prognosis of Li-ion battery degradation both at the single cell and the battery
pack level. Current projects include the evaluation of grid scale Li-ion battery energy storage systems; 
the evaluation of the impact of vehicle-to-grid strategies on electric vehicle battery pack degradation; 
and the testing of emerging battery technologies for grid-connected and transportation applications.
