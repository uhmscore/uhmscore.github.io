Nicolas Gaillard (PhD, Micro- and Nano-electronics, Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France) has over 10 years of experience in materials science, 
with an emphasis in the areas of photovoltaics, photoelectrochemical hydrogen production and integrated circuits. Following his graduate work, Dr. Gaillard 
spent 3 years with the IBM/Motorola/STMicroelectronics alliance working on oxide/metal interfaces for CMOS transistors and DRAM memories applications. 
He joined the Thin Films Laboratory of the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 2007 as a post-doctoral, working under 
the supervision of Dr. Eric Miller on metal oxide thin films for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Dr. Gaillard was appointed faculty and Thin 
Films Laboratory group leader in 2010. Dr. Gaillard’s current research projects include: (i) engineering of high efficiency PEC materials, with an emphasis 
on chalcopyrite materials (CuInGaSSe) and (ii) the development of novel nanocrystal inks for printable thin film photovoltaics.
